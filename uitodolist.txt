# VisitingVet UI/UX Implementation To-Do List

This list outlines the tasks required to implement the UI/UX enhancements identified in the state audit.

## Global Styles & Design System

- [x] Refine primary color palette (7-step scale) in `client/src/styles/design-system.scss`.
- [x] Refine secondary color palette (7-step scale) in `client/src/styles/design-system.scss`.
- [x] Refine neutral color palette (5-step scale) in `client/src/styles/design-system.scss`.
- [x] Update Bootstrap color variable overrides in `client/src/styles/_variables.scss` to use the refined palettes. *Dependency: Refined color palettes.*
- [x] Establish and document the 8px base grid system for spacing in `client/src/styles/design-system.scss`.
- [x] Update spacing scale ($spacers map) in `client/src/styles/_variables.scss` to reflect the 8px grid. *Dependency: 8px grid system definition.*
- [x] Update spacing utility CSS variables (`--spacing-*`) in `client/src/styles/main.scss` based on the 8px grid. *Dependency: Updated spacing scale in _variables.scss.*
- [x] Define standardized interactive states (hover, active, focus, disabled) base styles (e.g., transitions, focus outline base) potentially in `client/src/styles/main.scss` or `client/src/styles/design-system.scss`.

## Typography

- [x] Simplify type scale to 6 defined sizes in `client/src/styles/design-system.scss`.
- [x] Restrict available font weights to Regular (400), Medium (500), and Bold (700) in `client/src/styles/design-system.scss`.
- [x] Update font-size and font-weight Bootstrap overrides in `client/src/styles/_variables.scss`. *Dependency: Simplified type scale and weights.*
- [x] Audit and update components to use only the defined font weights consistently (e.g., check `buttons.scss`, `cards.scss`, headings, body text).

## Spacing

- [x] Audit and apply 8px grid spacing consistently for padding/margins within core components (`buttons.scss`, `cards.scss`, `forms.scss`, `modals.scss`). *Dependency: 8px grid system definition.*
- [x] Review and potentially adjust spacing utility classes in `client/src/styles/utility-classes.scss` for alignment with the 8px grid.

## Buttons (client/src/styles/components/buttons.scss)

- [x] Standardize padding for all button variants based on the 8px grid.
- [x] Standardize border-radius across all button variants (e.g., use `$border-radius-md`).
- [x] Ensure consistent icon spacing within buttons.
- [x] Implement standardized hover states for all button variants.
- [x] Implement standardized active states for all button variants.
- [x] Implement standardized focus states (using the defined accessible focus outline) for all button variants.
- [x] Implement standardized disabled states for all button variants.

## Cards (client/src/styles/components/cards.scss)

- [ ] Standardize padding between card header, body, and footer based on the 8px grid.
- [ ] Implement standardized hover states (e.g., subtle shadow increase).
- [ ] Implement standardized focus states for interactive cards or elements within cards.
- [ ] Review and ensure consistent styling definitions for themed card variants (`.card-primary`, `.card-secondary`, etc.).

## Forms (client/src/styles/components/forms.scss & component JSX files)

- [ ] Ensure input focus states have sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum 3:1) and use the standardized focus outline style defined globally. Target `client/src/styles/components/forms.scss`.
- [ ] Audit forms across the application (e.g., `LoginPage.jsx`, `RegisterPage.jsx`, `ProviderProfileEditPage.jsx`) and add missing `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes to unlabeled controls.
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling for form validation (error, success states) in `client/src/styles/components/forms.scss`.

## Navigation (client/src/components/Header.jsx & associated styles)

- [ ] Apply consistent padding (e.g., `var(--spacing-2) var(--spacing-3)`) to main navigation links (`.nav-link` within Header).
- [ ] Increase mobile navigation toggle button size (`.navbar-toggler`) to meet the minimum 44x44px touch target requirement. Adjust padding or icon size as needed.
- [ ] Verify text color contrast for navigation links against the header background in all states (scrolled/unscrolled, light/dark, active, hover) meets WCAG AA (4.5:1). Adjust colors in `Header.jsx` logic or associated CSS/SCSS.

## Layout & Grid

- [ ] Review Dashboard pages (`client/src/pages/Dashboard/*`) and ensure consistent application of grid and spacing between common elements like cards.
- [ ] Define and document standard container width strategy (e.g., max-width, padding) potentially in `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` or global styles.

## Responsiveness

- [ ] Test application across standard breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl) and identify/fix layout issues, particularly around the tablet (md) breakpoint. (Requires manual testing).
- [ ] Audit interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls) on mobile views and ensure they meet the 44x44px minimum touch target size. (Requires manual testing, includes Header toggle fix).
- [ ] Consider implementing fluid typography scaling between breakpoints if desired for smoother text resizing (Requires investigation and potentially new SCSS mixins/logic).

## Accessibility

- [ ] Perform a full color contrast audit using browser tools or online checkers. Fix identified issues:
    - [ ] Landing Page Hero text (`client/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` / `LandingPage.css`).
    - [ ] Form element focus states (`client/src/styles/components/forms.scss`).
    - [ ] Navigation link contrast (`client/src/components/Header.jsx`).
    - [ ] Other text/background combinations failing WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large/UI).
- [ ] Implement a consistent, highly visible focus indicator (e.g., 2px solid outline using a high-contrast color) for all interactive elements. Update base focus styles (`:focus`, `:focus-visible`) in `client/src/styles/main.scss` or component styles.
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation flow (Tab/Shift+Tab) across all pages and interactive components. Ensure logical order and that all interactive elements are reachable. (Requires manual testing).
- [ ] Implement skip links (e.g., "Skip to main content") for keyboard users. Add to `App.jsx` or `Header.jsx`.
- [ ] Review ARIA roles and attributes on complex components (modals, dropdowns, custom controls) for correctness and completeness. (Requires manual testing and JSX review).

## Specific Components/Pages

- [ ] Fix Landing Page Hero text contrast (`client/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` / `LandingPage.css`). *See Accessibility section.*
- [ ] Fix inconsistent spacing between cards on different Dashboard types (`client/src/pages/Dashboard/`). *See Layout/Grid section.*
