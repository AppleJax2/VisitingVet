# UI/UX Audit & Design System Implementation Tasks

## Component-Level Design Audit
- [x] Create inventory of all UI components (shared, page-specific, feature-specific)
- [x] Document all color hex values currently in use across components
- [x] Identify color inconsistencies and accessibility issues (WCAG contrast ratios)
- [x] Catalog hardcoded color values vs. theme variables
- [x] Document all spacing values (margin/padding) across components
- [x] Identify spacing inconsistencies between similar elements
- [x] Map all text elements to their CSS properties (font-size, weight, line-height)
- [x] Document responsive text scaling behavior
- [x] Catalog all breakpoints and component-specific media queries
- [x] Identify mobile adaptation issues and inconsistencies
- [x] Document all hover/focus/active states implementation
- [x] Catalog transition timings and animation implementations
- [x] Inventory all image formats/sizes in use
- [x] Identify icon inconsistencies and optimization opportunities

## Design System Specification
- [x] Define primary brand colors with light/dark variants
- [x] Define secondary brand colors with light/dark variants
- [x] Create functional color set (success, warning, error, info)
- [x] Develop neutral color scale (8-10 shades)
- [x] Verify text/background color combinations for accessibility
- [x] Create scale-based spacing system with named tokens
- [x] Define font stack (primary, secondary, monospace)
- [x] Create complete type scale with size/weight/line-height combinations
- [x] Define text categories with mobile and desktop values
- [x] Document button implementation standards (sizes, variants, states)
- [x] Document form input standards (text, select, radio, checkbox)
- [x] Define card and container design patterns
- [x] Standardize modal and dialog implementations
- [x] Document navigation element standards
- [x] Define exact breakpoint values
- [x] Specify container widths and column configurations
- [x] Standardize animation timing functions and durations
- [x] Create transition pattern library

## Implementation Roadmap
- [x] Perform component-by-component gap analysis
- [x] Create theme file structure in the project
- [x] Develop CSS/SCSS variables file with all design tokens
- [x] Prioritize components for update (shared → main pages → features)
- [x] Create implementation schedule with deadlines
- [x] Implement shared components first
- [x] Update main page components
- [x] Refactor feature-specific components
- [x] Create developer guidelines for implementing the design system
- [x] Define visual consistency metrics and accessibility targets

## Industry-Specific Considerations
- [x] Research color psychology for the product's industry
- [x] Develop color recommendations specific to target audience
- [x] Create information hierarchy guidelines for domain-specific content
