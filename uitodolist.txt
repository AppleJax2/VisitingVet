# UI/UX Audit & Design System Implementation Tasks

## Component-Level Design Audit
- [ ] Create inventory of all UI components (shared, page-specific, feature-specific)
- [ ] Document all color hex values currently in use across components
- [ ] Identify color inconsistencies and accessibility issues (WCAG contrast ratios)
- [ ] Catalog hardcoded color values vs. theme variables
- [ ] Document all spacing values (margin/padding) across components
- [ ] Identify spacing inconsistencies between similar elements
- [ ] Map all text elements to their CSS properties (font-size, weight, line-height)
- [ ] Document responsive text scaling behavior
- [ ] Catalog all breakpoints and component-specific media queries
- [ ] Identify mobile adaptation issues and inconsistencies
- [ ] Document all hover/focus/active states implementation
- [ ] Catalog transition timings and animation implementations
- [ ] Inventory all image formats/sizes in use
- [ ] Identify icon inconsistencies and optimization opportunities

## Design System Specification
- [ ] Define primary brand colors with light/dark variants
- [ ] Define secondary brand colors with light/dark variants
- [ ] Create functional color set (success, warning, error, info)
- [ ] Develop neutral color scale (8-10 shades)
- [ ] Verify text/background color combinations for accessibility
- [ ] Create scale-based spacing system with named tokens
- [ ] Define font stack (primary, secondary, monospace)
- [ ] Create complete type scale with size/weight/line-height combinations
- [ ] Define text categories with mobile and desktop values
- [ ] Document button implementation standards (sizes, variants, states)
- [ ] Document form input standards (text, select, radio, checkbox)
- [ ] Define card and container design patterns
- [ ] Standardize modal and dialog implementations
- [ ] Document navigation element standards
- [ ] Define exact breakpoint values
- [ ] Specify container widths and column configurations
- [ ] Standardize animation timing functions and durations
- [ ] Create transition pattern library

## Implementation Roadmap
- [ ] Perform component-by-component gap analysis
- [ ] Create theme file structure in the project
- [ ] Develop CSS/SCSS variables file with all design tokens
- [ ] Prioritize components for update (shared → main pages → features)
- [ ] Create implementation schedule with deadlines
- [ ] Implement shared components first
- [ ] Update main page components
- [ ] Refactor feature-specific components
- [ ] Create developer guidelines for implementing the design system
- [ ] Define visual consistency metrics and accessibility targets

## Industry-Specific Considerations
- [ ] Research color psychology for the product's industry
- [ ] Develop color recommendations specific to target audience
- [ ] Create information hierarchy guidelines for domain-specific content
- [ ] Define device strategy for all target platforms
- [ ] Design trust elements appropriate for the product category

## Deliverables
- [ ] Generate CSS/SCSS variables file with all design tokens
- [ ] Create design tool-ready color styles
- [ ] Create design tool-ready typography styles
- [ ] Create design tool-ready spacing styles
- [ ] Produce before/after visual examples of key components
- [ ] Develop implementation checklist with actionable tasks
- [ ] Create component status tracking system

## Specific Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Update global CSS variables/custom properties
- [ ] Refactor button components for consistency
- [ ] Standardize form input styling
- [ ] Create consistent card/container components
- [ ] Implement standardized spacing system
- [ ] Update typography across all components
- [ ] Refine responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Optimize image assets
- [ ] Standardize icon system
- [ ] Implement consistent animation/transitions
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements have proper states
- [ ] Implement accessibility improvements
- [ ] Create documentation for the design system
- [ ] Set up automated visual regression testing

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test all components against WCAG accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- [ ] Ensure consistent rendering across supported browsers
- [ ] Validate color contrast for all text elements
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Measure performance impacts of design system implementation
