# Administrator Vaccination Verification Handbook

## Overview

This guide covers the tools and processes for Administrators to manage and verify pet vaccination records submitted through the platform.

## Verification Dashboard

*   Navigate to the Admin section and select "Vaccination Verification".
*   The left panel shows the queue of records currently in "Pending" status requiring review.
*   Click on a record in the queue to load its details in the right panel.

## Reviewing Records

1.  **Select Record:** Choose a record from the pending queue.
2.  **Review Details:** Examine the information entered by the user (Vaccine Type, Dates).
3.  **Inspect Document:** Carefully review the uploaded document (photo/PDF).
    *   (Feature Enhancement: Side-by-side viewer with OCR extracted text).
    *   Check for clarity, completeness, and signs of tampering.
4.  **Verify Information:** Ensure the document supports the entered data (correct pet name, vaccine, dates, vet signature/stamp).
5.  **Check OCR/Analysis (If applicable):** Review any automated analysis results (OCR confidence, potential fraud flags).

## Making a Decision

*   **Approve:** If the record is accurate and the document is valid, click "Approve". The record status will change to "Verified".
*   **Reject:** If the record is invalid or the document is insufficient/suspicious, click "Reject".
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Provide a clear **Rejection Reason** in the designated field. This reason will be shown to the pet owner.
*   **Close:** If you need to move to another record without making a decision, click "Close".

## Reporting Dashboard

*   Navigate to the Admin section and select "Vaccination Reporting".
*   This dashboard provides analytics on verification volume, turnaround times, approval/rejection rates, and potential system issues.

## Escalation / Suspicious Activity

*   If you suspect fraudulent activity beyond a simple rejection, follow internal protocols for escalation or flagging the user account.
