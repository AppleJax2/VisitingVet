# Veterinarian Provider Electronic Signing Instructions

## Introduction

This guide explains how registered Veterinarians can use the platform to electronically sign vaccination certificates.

## Signing Portal

1.  Log in to your Veterinarian account.
2.  Navigate to your Dashboard (or the specific "Signing Portal" section).
3.  You will see a queue of certificates awaiting your signature.
    *   These certificates correspond to vaccination records that have likely been entered or verified by your clinic staff or automatically generated.

## Signing Certificates

*   **Review:** For each certificate in the queue, review the details (Pet Name, Vaccine, Dates) to ensure accuracy.
    *   (Feature Enhancement: Ability to preview the full PDF certificate before signing).
*   **Sign Individually:** Click the "Sign Certificate" button next to a specific certificate. This will apply your registered electronic signature.
*   **Batch Sign:** If you have reviewed multiple certificates and are confident in their accuracy, you can use the "Sign All" button to sign all pending certificates in the queue at once.
    *   **Caution:** Use batch signing responsibly after careful review.

## Workflow Notes

*   Once signed, the certificate becomes officially available to the pet owner.
*   The signed certificate will be removed from your pending queue.
*   If you notice an error in a certificate **before** signing, please contact the clinic staff or administrator responsible for generating/verifying the initial record to make corrections. The signing portal is typically the final step.

## Support

*   If you encounter issues with the signing portal or your electronic signature, please contact platform support.
