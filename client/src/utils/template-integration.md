This document outlines the strategy for integrating Bootstrap templates into the VisitingVet application.

## Selected Templates

Based on our research, we've selected the following templates/components for integration:

1. **Landing Page Template**: 
   - Based on the "Pet Haven" template with a clean, modern design
   - Focus on veterinary services, animal health, and mobile vet capabilities
   - Hero section with appointment scheduling call-to-action
   - Service cards section using Bootstrap grid

2. **Authentication Pages**:
   - Clean, minimal login/register forms
   - Multi-step registration process with Bootstrap form validation
   - Password reset and account verification styling

3. **Dashboard Templates**:
   - Admin view with sidebar navigation, data tables, and charts
   - Provider dashboard with appointment calendar and statistics
   - Pet owner dashboard with pet cards and appointment history
   - Clinic dashboard with scheduling interface

4. **Pet Profile Pages**:
   - Pet profile cards with responsive images
   - Medical history timeline
   - Vaccination record display
   - Appointment history cards

5. **Appointment Scheduling**:

6. **Admin Interface**:

   - Form controls for system configuration
   - Alert and notification components

## Color Scheme

We'll maintain the current color scheme as defined in the theme.js file:

- Primary: #577E46 (Sage Green)
- Secondary: #AC510A (Warm Terracotta)
- Accent Gold: #EDB75A
- Dark Green: #124438
- Light Green: #A8B99F
- Background Light: #F6E6BB (Cream)

## Integration Strategy

1. **Component by Component**: We'll integrate templates section by section, starting with the core layouts
2. **CSS Organization**: We'll organize CSS into component-specific files with shared utilities
3. **Responsive Design**: All components will be tested across breakpoints during integration
4. **Accessibility**: We'll ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Implementation Plan

1. Create base layouts for the different page types
2. Implement global components (header, footer, sidebar)
3. Style authentication pages
4. Build dashboard templates
5. Create pet profile components
6. Implement scheduling interfaces
7. Develop admin views
8. Test responsive behavior
9. Apply final styling adjustments

## Testing Strategy

Each template integration will be tested on:
- Mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
- Desktops (across major browsers)
- Accessibility (using axe or similar tools)
